# A Random Quote Generator in HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT
   In this quote app, each time you click on the next button youâ€™ll get a new quote.
       The Html & Css played part in structuring & styling respectively.
           - Added audio(with a link to download) & video elements.
       The functionality of the quotes randomly being generated from a fetched data is done by the Javascript:
           - Fetched data from API to make it much simpler & cleaner. It uses the promise to deliver more 
             flexible features to make requests to servers from the web browsers.
           - The fetch() requires the URL of the resource needed to be fetched.
           - Then we take the response, and return it into response.json() that returns a promise, 
           - Then inside we fire a function where we actually have access to that data, the part 
             where we did the work of making the quotes to be randomly generated
